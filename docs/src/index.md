# FRGn Documentation


A small package that contains some of the subroutines and function which I frequently use in my code to numerically solve the exact [Funcitonal Rrenormalisation Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_renormalization_group) equation in Graphene. The equations are motivated from the paper by Bauer et al [1]. Here apart from reproducing the result by them we also extend it to finite temperature and introduce the frequency dependence in the interraction term. See the [example page](examples.md).
